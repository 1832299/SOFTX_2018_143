### Value proposition
Dynamic cell refinement reduces computational costs for problems that changes over time by adapting the cell size automatically to accuracy requirements. For cases that are calculated in parallel the load between processors might become imbalanced resulting in idle processor time. 

The dynamic refinement algorithm of OpenFOAM is enhanced by  

* adding very flexible refinement based on multiple criteria 
* and additional to the 3D a 2D and 2.5D refinement
* fixing severe bugs regarding 
* 
    - face addressing, 
    - mapping of cell and boundary fields between refinement states
    - and flux flipping
Load balancing is made possible by a sophisticated redistribution algorithm already implemented in OpenFOAM. The load balancing code of T.G. Voskuilen and was stabilized fixing bugs regarding

* flux flipping of non flux fields
* and boundary mapping 
load balancing is made available here exemplarily for, but not limited to, the interDyMFoam solver family. 

Two unit cases illustrate the main bug fixes and several tutorial cases show possible use cases in the area of multiphase flows of the dynamic refinement in combination with load balancing.

### Utilities ###
###### meshUpdater
Updates the mesh calling `mesh.update()`. Depending on the selected mesh type in `dynamicMeshDict`, an adaptive mesh refinement and a load balancing step is performed.
Thereby all volume and surface fields are mapped onto the new mesh or processor distribution. 

An overwrite option is available `-overwrite`

###### initSurfaceFields
A utility used for unit testcases which initializes a `surfaceScalarField mySurfaceScalarField;` and a `surfaceVectorField mySurfaceVectorField;` which are initialized with the distance to the domain origin.


### Test Cases ###
##### surfaceFieldMapping
A domain with two cells is initialized using the utility `initSurfaceFields`. Calling `meshUpdater` the domain is refined in one step into 16 cells. This creates 12 internal patches which are of main interest here. Our library setup tackles two serious issues which have been identified using this case: 

*    **Wrong addressing of internal patches**: This problem arises in the function call [`hexRef8::addInternalFace()`](https://bitbucket.org/drettenmaier/amr_lb_publication/commits/1cef6f9569fe7525b5b769c43c910ec50dbd6785?at=master#chg-src/dynamicMesh/polyTopoChange/polyTopoChange/hexRef8/hexRef8.C), where a new internal face is either "expanded" from a master face or without a master face. As we understand it, the first option makes no sense and furthermore changes the face index to meshFacei, which in the following corresponds to some other face which is not related with the new one. The newly created internal face always need a face index of -1. So we simply removed the option of creating an internal face with a corresponding master-face index.

*    **No mapping of non flux surfaceFields**: Currently the newly created internal faces have no build in mapping mechanism of surfaceFields at the refinement step. Only fluxes, which are listed in `dynamicMeshDict`, are recalulated after the mesh refinement step, which only works for surfaceScalarFields. So we introduced a surfaceFields mapping for fields which are listed in a new list called mapSurfaceFields in [`dynamicMeshDict`](https://bitbucket.org/drettenmaier/amr_lb_publication/src/a32f2ac2e862694962dcd6751467e9925193e715/OpenFOAM/src/dynamicFvMesh/dynamicRefineBalancedFvMesh/dynamicMeshDict?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default). The fields of internal faces are averaged using the three adjacent unrefined face values.

##### LoadBalancingSurfaceFieldFlip
A domain with three cells is decomposed manually. processor0 with one and processor1 with two cells. The cell at processor0 gets refined which leads to an imbalance higher than the minimal threshold for load balancing. **During the rebalancing step all surfaceFields get mapped using the flipping mechanism** as it is only correct for fluxes. Signs of the surfaceFields are falsly changed at processor patches if they don't represent a flux.
Code changes are were necessary in [`fvMeshDistribute/fvMeshDistributeTemplates.C`]((https://bitbucket.org/drettenmaier/amr_lb_publication/commits/1cef6f9569fe7525b5b769c43c910ec50dbd6785?at=master#chg-src/dynamicMesh/fvMeshDistribute/fvMeshDistributeTemplates.C), [`fvMeshSubset/fvMeshSubsetInterpolate.C`]((https://bitbucket.org/drettenmaier/amr_lb_publication/commits/1cef6f9569fe7525b5b769c43c910ec50dbd6785?at=master#chg-src/dynamicMesh/fvMeshSubset/fvMeshSubsetInterpolate.C) and [`src/finiteVolume/interpolation/mapping/fvFieldMappers/MapFvSurfaceField.H`](https://bitbucket.org/drettenmaier/amr_lb_publication/commits/1cef6f9569fe7525b5b769c43c910ec50dbd6785?at=master#chg-dontFlipSurfaceVectorFields.patch)
In some cases we still observe a flipping of `surfaceVectorFields` using the `decomposePar` method. The work-flow of initializing a surfaceVectorField and then decompose the domain is therefore not recommended.

##### damBreakAMR_LB
The damBreak case is set up with an adaptive mesh refinement and load balancing. `interDyMFoam` recalculates the flux `phi` after a mesh.update() call using the surfaceVectorField `Uf`, where in earlier versions of OF `fvc::interpolate(U)` was used. Without the appropriate mapping of new internal faces and the careful handling of the face flipping operator AMR+LB simulations only run through with some luck.

##### dropImpact3D
A drop impact simulation is set up. An already falling drop with wake is initialized right above the surface. Main input parameters are the drop volume, the drop impact velocity and the constant contact angle between the solid-liquid and the liquid gas interface. The interface is refined in two levels. Since the drop surface changes fast over time, load balancing and dynamic refinement are a perfect fit for tis case.

When changing the mesh OpenFOAM provides the functionality to map a value between those changes. A the index of a later refined cell is mapped to its child cells and vice versa. In the current OpenFOAM versions however no default mapping is implemented for boundaries that hold a gradient, such as `alphaContactAngleFvPatchField.H` and its base-class `fixedGradientFvPatchField.H` or `mixedFvPatchField.H`. The gradient representation is reallocated in size but not properly initialized. A call for `evaluate()` on the boundary at the load balancing might therefore lead to an error. 

This issue is fixed exemplarily for the [alphaContactAngle](https://bitbucket.org/drettenmaier/amr_lb_publication/src/a32f2ac2e862694962dcd6751467e9925193e715/OpenFOAM/src/twoPhaseProperties/alphaContactAngle/alphaContactAngleFvPatchScalarField.H?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default) by specifying the mapper. The gradient on newly added faces is set to zero. To be save make sure that cells containing the three-phase contact line are not refined. Note that when using e.g. `fixedFluxPressure` a similar specification is necessary.
