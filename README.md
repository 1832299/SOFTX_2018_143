### How do I get set up? ###
* `./Allwmake.sh`
* The `dynamic*Mesh` classes are a copy of the current **OF-4-dev** branch.
* If some solver needs dynamic linking of the libraries, make sure to source the new ones in `$FOAM_USER_LIBBIN`
* Use the `dynamicMeshDict` as provided in the folder `dynamicRefineBalancedFvMesh`.
* Use the test cases as a basis for new ones.

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Daniel Rettenmaier: rettenmaier@gsc.tu-darmstadt.de
* Daniel Deising: deising@mma.tu-darmstadt.de

### Utilities ###
###### meshUpdater
Updates the mesh calling `mesh.update()`. Depending on the selected mesh type in `dynamicMeshDict`, an adaptive mesh refinement and a load balancing step is performed.
Thereby all volume and surface fields are mapped onto the new mesh or processor distribution. 

An overwrite option is provided using `-overwrite`

###### initSurfaceFields
Initializes a `surfaceScalarField mySurfaceScalarField;` and a `surfaceVectorField mySurfaceVectorField;` which are initialized with the distance to the domain origin.


### Test Cases ###
###### unitTest_surfaceFieldMapping
A domain with two cells is initialized using the utility `initSurfaceFields`. Calling `meshUpdater` the domain is refined in one step into 16 cells. This creates 12 internal patches which are of main interest here. Our library setup tackles two serious issues which have been identified using this case: 

*    **Wrong addressing of internal patches**: This problem arises in the function call [`hexRef8::addInternalFace()`](https://bitbucket.org/drettenmaier/amrandloadbalancing/commits/1cef6f9569fe7525b5b769c43c910ec50dbd6785?at=master#chg-src/dynamicMesh/polyTopoChange/polyTopoChange/hexRef8/hexRef8.C), where a new internal face is either "expanded" from a master face or without a master face. As we understand it, the first option makes no sense and furthermore changes the face index to meshFacei, which in the following corresponds to some other face which is not related with the new one. The newly created internal face always need a face index of -1. So we simply removed the option of creating an internal face with a corresponding master-face index.

*    **No mapping of non flux surfaceFields**: Currently the newly created internal faces have no build in mapping mechanism of surfaceFields at the refinement step. Only fluxes, which are listed in `dynamicMeshDict`, are recalulated after the mesh refinement step, which only works for surfaceScalarFields. So we introduced a surfaceFields mapping for fields which are listed in a new list called mapSurfaceFields in [`dynamicMeshDict`](https://bitbucket.org/drettenmaier/amrandloadbalancing/src/26a3400e190a7da40530133bba3293e4634ebb73/src/dynamicFvMesh/dynamicRefineBalancedFvMesh/dynamicMeshDict?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default). The fields of internal faces are averaged using the three adjacent unrefined face values.

###### unitTest_LoadBalancingSurfaceFieldFlip
A domain with three cells is decomposed manually. processor0 with one and processor1 with two cells. The cell at processor0 gets refined which leads to an imbalance higher than the minimal threshold for load balancing. **During the rebalancing step all surfaceFields get mapped using the flipping mechanism** as it is only correct for fluxes. Signs of the surfaceFields are falsly changed at processor patches if they don't represent a flux.
